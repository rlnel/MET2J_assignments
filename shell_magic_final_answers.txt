1.1 Welcome! 
Get-ChildItem (or gci) shows Length, Name, Mode, LastWriteTime. 
Get-Alias ls gave the command Get-ChildItem the shorcut "ls" (not "1s") 


1.2 Get help
Get-Help Remove-Item some basic gave info on how to remove an item. Info on its Aliases & examples of syntax
Get-Help Remove-Item -Detailed helps to gives much more detailed information on Remove-Item. Includes parameters, desription, synopsis
PS C:\MET2J\Week 2 Programming, hardware, software> Get-Help Remove-Item -Detailed
You can add the -Filter (-fi) option to Get-ChildItem to filter for files with certain names or extensions 
To list the contents of my Week 2 folder I used the commands "gci -r" to list the contents of my folder (only 2 items) 

2.1 Looking around
Get-Location (gl) shows me that I'm currently working from the following working directory: C:\MET2J\Week 2 Programming, hardware, software
sl .. 
sl "top_secret" 
New working directory set as "top_secret"

3.1 Creating an empty file 
PS C:\MET2J\Week 2 Programming, hardware, software\top_secret> New-Item "hello_world"

3.3 Making, moving & renaming files 
PS C:\MET2J\Week 2 Programming, hardware, software\top_secret> New-Item -ItemType directory Hello_this_cruel_world
To avoid confusion I named the folder "hello_world" as "Hello_this_cruel_world"
Also, cannot create hello_world in shell_magic, because shell_magic is a .txt file, not a working directory 
PS C:\MET2J\Week 2 Programming, hardware, software\top_secret> Rename-Item ".\hello_world.bfe"  
".\hello_world.bfe" renamed to "".\hello_world.txt" 
To move (mv) my renamed file to the Hello_this_cruel_world folder, used the -Destination function 
PS C:\MET2J\Week 2 Programming, hardware, software\top_secret> Move-Item ".\hello_world.txt" -Destination ".\Hello_this_cruel_world\"
Then I set my directory to Hello_this_cruel_world

3.4 Copying files 
shell_magic is not a folder it is a .txt file (but I created a folder within Hello_this_cruel_world called shell_magic). 
Then I copied hello_world.txt from Hello_this_cruel_world to shell_magic
PS C:\MET2J\Week 2 Programming, hardware, software\top_secret\Hello_this_cruel_world> Copy-Item ".\hello_world.txt" -Destination ".\shell_magic\"
Then I renamed to world_hello using the following command
PS C:\MET2J\Week 2 Programming, hardware, software\top_secret\Hello_this_cruel_world> sl "shell_magic"
PS C:\MET2J\Week 2 Programming, hardware, software\top_secret\Hello_this_cruel_world\shell_magic> rni ".\hello_world.txt"
First I set my working directory to shell_magic (my folder within Hello_cruel_world) then i could rename my copied version of hello_world from there. 

3.5 Removing Files and Directories
So I first moved back to my hello_this_cruel_world directory (out of the shell_magic folder) 
Then I removed using rm "hello_world.txt" 
PS C:\MET2J\Week 2 Programming, hardware, software\top_secret\Hello_this_cruel_world> rm ".\hello_world.txt"
First I removed the shell_magic file from the "Hello_this_cruel_world" folder (and all it's contents) 
The following message appeared 
The item at C:\MET2J\Week 2 Programming, hardware,
software\top_secret\Hello_this_cruel_world\shell_magic has children and the
Recurse parameter was not specified. If you continue, all children will be
removed with the item. Are you sure you want to continue?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help
(default is "Y"): (then I continued with Yes) 
Then I removed the entire "Hello_this_cruel_world" folder (quite scary) 

4.1 Displaying file contents 
Could not find the contents of this file because it does not exist (I removed it in the previous step) 


4.2 Redirecting Standard Output with > and >>
Using echo I was able to write the words file contents in file.txt
PS C:\MET2J\Week 2 Programming, hardware, software\top_secret> echo 'hello world' > ".\hello_world.txt"
PS C:\MET2J\Week 2 Programming, hardware, software\top_secret> echo 'file contents' > 'file.txt'
PS C:\MET2J\Week 2 Programming, hardware, software\top_secret> echo 'more contents'>> file.txt
PS C:\MET2J\Week 2 Programming, hardware, software\top_secret> echo 'even more contents' >> file.txt

4.3 Prevent Cluttering your Terminal 
Out-Host sends output to your PowerShell to be displayed.
